change below:

``` json
"timesync_config": {
        "enable_timesync": true,
        "device_name": "/dev/ttyUSB2",
        "comm_device_type": 0,
        "baudrate_index": 6,
        "parity_index": 0     
    }
```

for baud rate lookup table, refer to line 87 of `livox_ros_driver/timesync/user_uart/user_uart.cpp`

make sure the device name is the same as the serial you connect.

if you use a virtual serial port (USB), the name should be `/dev/ttyACMx` where 'x' is the port number.

use `sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyXXXx` to modify permission first.
